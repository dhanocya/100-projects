          <h1>Flowing with Hope: Cancer Awareness</h1>
          <p>
            Cancer is not a single disease, but a complex group of more than 100
            diseases that share a common, life-altering characteristic: the
            uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells within the body. In
            a healthy body, cells follow an orderly process of growth, division,
            and death, guided by a set of genetic instructions. Cancer occurs
            when specific gene changes disrupt this balance, causing cells to
            ignore normal "stop" signals and multiply relentlessly.
